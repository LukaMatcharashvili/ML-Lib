### Machine Learning Library for C++

This is a simple machine learning library for C++ that I wrote for my own learning purposes. It is not meant to be used in production code, but rather as a learning tool for understanding machine learning algorithms. The library is not using any external libraries. Library also supports Vector and Matrix manipulation.

Features:

- [x] Matrix data structures and operations
- [x] Vector data structures and operations
- [x] Batch gradient descent
- [x] Stochastic gradient descent
- [x] Mini-batch gradient descent
- [x] Data Encoding
- [x] Loading data from CSV files
- [x] Data splitting
- [x] Loading and saving weights and biases to files
- [x] Feature scaling
- [x] Polynomial features
- [x] Linear regression
- [x] Logistic regression
- [ ] Visualization
- [ ] Neural network
- [ ] Utilize GPU
- [ ] Decision tree
- [ ] Random forest
- [ ] Performance measurements
- [ ] Utilize multi-threading
